## Saving your Data in Browser Linux
- ### Autosave
   - Autosave can be enabled by adding ```?autosave=n``` (n is the number of seconds) to the end of the url or simply toggling it in the menu 
   - By default it saves every 30 seconds. If you make a change and close it before autosave runs your changes will be lost.
   - Currently closing the page with any program running such as vim will create issues the next time you navigate to that page. If you accidentally do this try to exit the program. If you can't, you may have to start over.
  
- ### Downloading a save
  - You can download a save state that can be loaded back in at anytime. This is good for taking backups. See [toolbox.md](toolbox.md)
