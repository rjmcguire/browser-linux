Welcome to Browser Linux!

This is a custom buildroot running inside the v86 emulator. It has been tweaked to be as fast as possible and has the following packages installed:

busybox utilities
ascii_invaders
sl
lua
bc
pfetch
vim 
nano
mg (emacs)
mc
ed
lynx
htop
sudo

You can get network access by running udhcpc as root.
Browser-linux uses copy's proxy which is slow and bandwidth limited and https does not work.
