- ## Bugs
  - the update to buildroot 2022.8 seems to have messed up the screen. It is not critical but should be fixed at some point
- ## Features to add 
  - Custom iso for embedded 
    - It would be nice to be able to pass a custom iso from the host to the iframe. It currently is being worked on in startup.js (see iso section)
  - More customization
    - custom usernames
    - custom shell themes
    - Custom iso upload and save
  - functional updates to saved states
    - I need a way to update the iso itself without losing data
    - This might be able to be solved by having a virtual hdd
  - better software selection
    - It would be nice to have a better way of getting software in browser linux
