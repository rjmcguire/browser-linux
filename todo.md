- ## Features to add 
  - Custom iso for embedded 
    - It would be nice to be able to pass a custom iso from the host to the iframe. It currently is being worked on in startup.js (see iso section)
  - Appimage support
    - Dedicated library that has 32bit only?
  - More customization
    - custom usernames
    - custom shell themes
    - Custom iso upload and save
  - Custom UI for building images
    - This would be really hard to implement
    - There could be a simple script that generates a iso that you can upload.
  - functional updates to saved states
    - I need a way to update the iso itself without losing data
    - This might be able to be solved by having a virtual hdd
