- ## Bugs
  - When an save is restored with an application running such as vim the user is greeted with a black screen. The program is still running but doesn't refresh the terminal. Solutions:
    - Send key combo to close the application
    - force the application to refresh the screen somehow (likely fix)
- ## Features to add 
  - Appimage support
    - Dedicated library that has 32bit only?
  - More customization
    - custom usernames
    - custom shell themes
    - Custom iso upload and save
  - Custom UI for building images
    - This would be really hard to implement
    - There could be a simple script that generates a iso that you can upload.
  - functional updates to saved states
    - I need a way to update the iso itself without losing data
    - This might be able to be solved by having a virtual hdd
